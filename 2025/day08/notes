have a dictionary of point, connections, 

points (matrix)
connections (eucalidean_dict)
circuits (circuit_list)

create check_list of index from matrix.

iterate through connections.

if both nodes are in the check_list - create
else if A is not in check_list:
    if B is in check_list:
        - both are connected - ignore

    else:
    
a - No connected
    b- not connected
    MAKE New

a - not connected
    B- connected
        connect A to B's cuircuit

a - connected
    b - not connected
        ADD B to a's circuit_list
    
    b - connected

        a-b in same cuitcite
            DO NOTHING

        a-b NOT in same cuirvuit
            JOIN
